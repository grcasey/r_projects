# Exploration of data for NYC flights in 2013 

## Description of the project:
I use publicly available dataset of NYC flights for 2013, and copy it to MySQL database using Amazon RDS by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
Then, I read data from the database and conduct an exploratory analysis. 

## Connection to database:
First, database parameters should be stored in environment variables on bash.
RStudio or any other enterprise-ready professional software for R statistical computing should be launched from Terminal window to pick up stored environment variables:

Example:
```
open -na Rstudio
```

## How to run:
Run RcodeAWS_RDS.r file.
