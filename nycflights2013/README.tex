# Exploration of data for NYC flights in 2013

I use publicly-available dataset of NYC flights for 2013, and copy it to MySQL database using Amazon RDS by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Then, I read data from the database and conduct an exploratory analysis. 

## Connection to database:
First, database parameters should be stored in environment variables on bash.
R-studio or any other enterprise-ready professional software for R statistical computing should be launch from Terminal to pick up stored environment variables
open -na Rstudio

## How to run:
Run RcodeAWS_RDS.r file.
